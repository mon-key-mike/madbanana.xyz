### 1. DAO on Base  
The Mad Banana Union operates as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) built on Base, ensuring governance is in the hands of the community. Through a system of votes and proposals, members can shape the direction of the ecosystem, from funding new projects to tweaking economic models. This structure allows for decentralized decision-making, ensuring that no single entity controls the fate of the Mad Bananas. With smart contracts automating governance, transparency and fairness are embedded into the very core of the DAO.  

Participation in the DAO isn’t just about casting votes—it’s about contributing to the madness. Whether you're a strategist, creative mind, or a chaos enthusiast, there are countless ways to influence the Union’s next moves. The DAO’s structure rewards active members, giving them more influence over key decisions. As the ecosystem evolves, the Base blockchain provides the speed and scalability needed to fuel rapid growth while keeping transaction costs low.  

### 2. How to Earn $MAD  
$MAD is the lifeblood of the Mad Banana Union, and there are several ways to stack up on this chaotic currency. Members can earn $MAD through participation in governance, completing community challenges, staking assets, and contributing valuable content. Whether it’s engaging in social media antics, helping expand the lore, or winning wild competitions, the Union always finds a way to reward madness.  

Beyond community efforts, $MAD can also be earned through the Mad Money Lab’s experimental financial mechanisms, liquidity pools, and partnerships within the metaverse. The token is designed to be as unpredictable as the bananas themselves, constantly shifting in value and utility. With a growing ecosystem, the opportunities to earn and utilize $MAD are always expanding—so stay active, stay involved, and get MAD.
